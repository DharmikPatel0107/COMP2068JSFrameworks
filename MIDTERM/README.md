Regard Midterm Task 1: Create a New Express Project (6 marks) Scaffold the Project: Use the Express Generator tool to quickly scaffold a new Express project. This tool generates the project structure, including basic routes, views, and configurations. Modify Layout View: Bootstrap CSS: Enhance the appearance of your application by adding Bootstrap’s CSS link to the project’s main layout view. Jumbotron: Incorporate a Jumbotron at the top of your main layout, displaying your full name. Navigation Bar: Implement a navigation bar with links to /home and /student, facilitating easy navigation. Footer: Add a footer displaying your student number. Task 2: Set Up a Database Connection (13 marks) Install Packages: Install necessary packages (mongoose for MongoDB interaction, dotenv for environment variable management) to connect your application to a database. Configure Environment: Use the dotenv package to securely store and access your database connection string through a .env file. Connect to Database: Modify app.js to establish a connection to your database using the connection string stored in the .env file. Model Creation: Create a Models folder to organize your data models. Inside this folder, create a Student.js file defining a Student model with StudentNumber, FirstName, LastName, and EmailAddress fields, all of which are strings and required. Task 3: Implement CRUD Functionality for /Student (13 marks) Router Setup: Create a students.js file in the routes directory to handle requests related to students. This involves defining routes for creating and reading student records. CRUD Operations: CREATE: Implement a route to add new student records to the database. READ: Implement a route to retrieve and display all student records from the database. Views for CRUD: Develop views that correspond to the CRUD functionalities. For the READ operation, create a view that displays a table of all students in the database, along with a button to navigate to the form for adding a new student. By completing these tasks, you will have created an Express web application that utilizes a MongoDB database to store and manage student data, including the ability to create new student records and read (list) all existing records in a styled and navigable interface.
